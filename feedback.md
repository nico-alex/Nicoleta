## Assignment resources

My only source of information for completing the assignment was the Mendix documentation portal.
Starting from the [Building a Responsive Web App](https://docs.mendix.com/quickstarts/responsive-web-app/) link you provided, I was able to navigate through the docs pages to identify the necessary information. I've found the reference guide very well structured and easy to follow.
What really stood out to me was the very useful and strategically placed **Quick Starts** section.


## Mendix Studio Pro feedback

Mendix Studio Pro and all its dependencies were very easy to install, as one would expect from a low-code app platform. Expectation, though, is not always in line with reality.

I did run into a refresh issue, though. Errors in the error pane would get stuck, despite them being fixed. They would only clear once I'd restarted the application.
